My name is Paul Davis, I’m a 4th year computer science student graduating in May 2024 with honors from the University of Stirling.
I am passionate about geography and maps and could spend hours looking at them.
In my last year at university, I wrote a 14,000 dissertation documenting the creation from start to finish of a mobile application
that tracks a user’s movements over time and based off that data,
the user can learn about various statistics that inform them about either the type of people they are or who they tend to live around.

Some of my favorite websites are the following: 
https://earth.google.com/

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to me via my email.
